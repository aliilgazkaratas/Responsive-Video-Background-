Responsive Video Background that I learnt from Web Dev Simplified

I have done this project with these steps:

Firstly, I have watched the Youtube video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ITxSzjZUc

After I got what he did, I start coding <b>without looking video</b> (No parrot style)

When sometimes I stuck in some cases, I turn back the video and checked the part that I struggle.

What I learnt from this project : 
<ul>
<li>Video elements properties like autoplay, loop, muted etc.</li>
<li>Implementation of z-index</li>
<li>I get to re-check some topics</li>
<li>transform: translate concept.</li>
</ul>

Degree of Difficulty : Easy
